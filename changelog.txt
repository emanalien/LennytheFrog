4/2/20: 3
- Created room template for the pond
- created better code for camera and viewport in obj_camera
- started to setup lenny section reset after 3 deaths
- started to setup room transitions - TODO: these need a lot of work. see notes in GameManager. a new object which creates fade ins and outs
			should be created to help manage these fade ins as they don't seem to be working as it stands.
- built a short tester level called rm_pond1

5/2/20: 4
- worked on transitions, with fades having their own object with settings that can be change based on fade in or out.
- fades call a event_user script at end of fade.
- started working on remembering captured flys and destorying them when a room is entered thatyou've been in before.
- above is unfinished, with @TODO signifiying where work needs to be done.
- succuessfully implemented system were caught flies are stored in localCaughtFlies and at the end of a level moved over to BM.CaughtFlyArray
- this system is not fully tested, but should mean that on reentry to a existing level, flies already caught are not respawned
- it relies on the GM checking each fly object after it's created to see it's uniqueID and seeing if it matches one in the BM.CFA.
- num_flies is now just a int not a dynamic check, incremented by creating and deleting flies.
